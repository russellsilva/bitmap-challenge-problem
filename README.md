# Challenge problem 2

from Ryan Wise at LegitScript. 2015-07/21

Given a collection C of integers, return an integer not in C.  

Let N be the length of C (i.e., the number of integers in C).  These are the problem constraints/parameters:

- 1 <= N <= 4 Billion
- each element of C is a non-negative, 32-bit integer
- C is not inherently ordered
- your return value must be a non-negative, 32-bit integer
